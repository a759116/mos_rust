# Application Development with Rust
## Abstract
## Introduction
I developed this code as part of my learning Rust. I had already developed the same in Python and C as part of my class assignment. I didn't have to spend time in developing logic, rather I focussed on devleoping the same using Rust. This expedited my learning process. In this article, I would want to sharer the use-cases, and the design that I based this code on. My hope was that this would help the reader not to worry about the use-case or design, rather the reader would explore the implementation using Rust, and this could expedite the Rust learning for the reader.

The use-case section of this article would link to the page with problem description. The design section would details the code structure. The run and extend section would detail the process to run this code, prerequisities, and options to extend this code. I hope that this would make it easier for the reader to learn Rust.
## Use-cases
The use-cases have been borrowed from NYU Cyberfellow class Introduction to Operating Systems. This class has a number of assignments to help the students to better understand various concepts in Operating System. This specific code has implementation for two of those assignments: 
* Memory allocation lab: This lab project addresses the various memory-management schemes in an operating system.
* Virtual lab: This lab project addresses the implementation of page-replacement algorithms in a demand-paging system.
